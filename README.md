## Notes and solutions  
  
  I'm not going to complete all the problems in this book. Instead, 
I will only focus on the questions that are difficult enough for me to figure out, but not way too challenging.<br />
  
Some of the solutions are in pdf format, this is because I accidentally deleted those solutions on my IDE, 
because they were terribly organized and I thought of them as unneeded files. Luckily, 
I have a habit of taking a screenshot of every program I have written and pasting them to my notebook.
  
  Feel welcome to read my notes. I have included my process of figuring out those difficult problems. <br />  
    
### Just for demonstration, below is a screenshot of some portion of my note
